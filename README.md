# Compiler 💻

This project explores various concepts and techniques in compiler design and implementation. A compiler is a fundamental tool in computer science responsible for translating high-level programming languages into executable code that can be run on a computer. 🚀

## Introduction 📝

A compiler typically consists of several stages, each performing specific tasks in the translation process. These stages may include lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, parsing, code generation, and optimization. Each stage plays a crucial role in transforming source code into machine-executable instructions. 🛠️

## Implemented Tasks 📋

This project implements the following tasks, each focusing on different aspects of compiler design:

1. **Regular Expressions to Non-Deterministic Finite Automata** 📜
2. **Non-Deterministic Finite Automata to Deterministic Finite Automata** 🔍
3. **Fallback Deterministic Finite Automata** 🔀
4. **Context-Free Grammars Epsilon & Unit Rules Elimination** ✂️
5. **Context-Free Grammars Left-Recursion Elimination** ↩️
6. **Context-Free Grammars First and Follow** 📊
7. **LL(1) Parsing** 🧩
8. **ANTLR Lexical Analysis** 🅰️
9. **ANTLR Parsing** 📖
