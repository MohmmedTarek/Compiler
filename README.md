For this task, you need to implement the **classical algorithm** for constructing a **deterministic finite automaton (DFA)** equivalent to a given **non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) 🤖**. 

Recall that an NFA is a quintuple (**Q, Σ, δ, q0, F**): **Q** is a non-empty, finite set of states; **Σ** is non-empty, finite set of symbols (an alphabet); **δ : Q × (Σ ∪ {ε}) −→ P(Q)** is the transition function; **q0 ∈ Q** is the start state; and **F ⊆ Q** is the set of accept states 🤔. 

Given a description of an NFA, you need to construct an equivalent DFA 🛠️.
